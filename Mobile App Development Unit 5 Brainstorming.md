1. Calendar - Allows to stay organized. User uses this app to keep track of financial due dates, upcoming events, potential work changes, allowing users to be productive and understand when a deadline or appointment is upcoming.

2. Duolingo - Allows users to test the waters essentially and learn multiple languages with fun and quick lessons. Users can set their own learning goals. Consistency is key. Excellent for individuals who plan on international travel as it will allow them to have some experience with the language spoken at their vacation destination.

3. WhatsApp - A great alternative to the traditional messenger app that our smartphones come with. Users have the ability to chat, voice call, and video call anyone they please. There is no limit to international connection as this app allows users to converse with those who are not in their country with no additional charge to their phone bill. While also eliminating the Android and iOS faulty photo/video exchange where receivers often receive blurry images or videos. WhatsApp is very benefitical overall.

1. Telegram
Telegram is a versatile messaging app that stands out for its super simple and intuitive interface. Unlike other messaging apps like Facebook Messenger, where settings and options can feel cluttered, Telegram makes it incredibly easy to find any setting or information you need. The app is lightweight, fast, and well-organized, allowing users to access chats, groups, and media effortlessly. Additionally, it offers secure, cloud-based storage, meaning messages and files sync across devices seamlessly. I like Telegram because it combines ease of use with powerful features, such as bots, channels, and encrypted messaging, all while remaining ad-free and highly customizable.

2. Samsung Health
Samsung Health is a comprehensive health and fitness app that helps users track their physical activities, monitor their heart rate, and log nutrition and sleep data. It integrates with wearable devices like Samsung smartwatches, providing real-time health insights. The app encourages users to maintain a balanced lifestyle by setting fitness goals and tracking daily progress. I appreciate Samsung Health because it keeps all my health metrics in one place, allowing me to monitor my daily steps, workouts, and even stress levels, helping me stay consistent with my fitness journey.

3. Nike Run Club
Nike Run Club is an excellent app for runners of all levels. It offers guided runs, personalized coaching plans, and real-time tracking of pace, distance, and elevation. The app also has social features that allow users to compete with friends and stay motivated through challenges. I like Nike Run Club because it keeps me accountable in my running progress, provides valuable insights on my performance, and makes running more enjoyable with its built-in encouragement and achievement tracking.

1. Apple Music
Apple Music iis where I save all of my liked songs and create playlists.There are many apps like it for streaming music, but it has features that make it superior for me. Some examples include its seamless integration with my other Apple products, superior sound quality thanks to Dolby Atmos offerring lossless audio and Spatial Audio, and its display of lyrics.

2. TikTok
This is my most used social media app and it a central place to find all sorts of content. While videos on here are typically under a minute long, there are options to also create long form content. However, the thing that is most central to this app is its algorithm that cultivates a timeline catered to what I like to see the most. Additionally, the culture on this app has created so many creative, fun, or informational trends that make it so enjoyable.

3. Map My Run
Map My Run provides detailed data about the runs that you go on. This features it provides includes the routes you take, miles run, total time, pace, and more. It is really convenient in tracking my progress to see how I have improved my running abilities.
