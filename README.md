# Project 5 - Trivia Game

Submitted by: Christopher Petit

The Trivia Game is an app that will challenge users with trivia questions spanning a variety of categories and difficulties, providing a dynamic, interactive learning experience. By integrating SwiftUI for the UI and networking to fetch trivia data, students will demonstrate their ability to create complex iOS applications. The app will dynamically fetch trivia questions and display them to the user in a format that encourages interaction.

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] App launches to an Options screen where user can modify the types of questions presented when the game starts. Users should be able to choose:
  - [X] Number of questions
  - [X] Category of questions
  - [X] Difficulty of questions
  - [X] Type of questions (Multiple Choice or True False)
- [X] User can tap a button to start trivia game, this presents questions and answers in a List or Card view.
  - Hint: For Card view visit your FlashCard app. List view is an equivalent to UITableView in UIKit. Much easier to use!
- [X] Selected choices are marked as user taps their choice (but answered is not presented yet!)
- [X] User can submit choices and is presented with a score on trivia game
 
The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User has answer marked as correct or incorrect after submitting choices (alongside their score).
- [X] Implement a timer that puts pressure on the user! Choose any time that works and auto submit choices after the timer expires. 

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
      I could clean up the app a little bit, add some borders, the app seems clusterd together with some of the fetched data not being ultimately clear.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- I had an issue fetching the data, I only ended up implementing some of the fetch categories in my app, but it was more than 5 total which I see as a positive.
